This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset, we preprocess the data, train a decision tree model, and evaluate its performance to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior.
